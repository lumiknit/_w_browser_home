# Browser Home

A single file browser home page.

I created it for some android browser which has too restricted customize of new tab page.

## Feature

- Show clock & bookmarks & URL navigation with duckduckgo search
- Customizable bookmarks (items change, folded items, column count)
- Color scheme (dark mode) support
- Open home page in new tab.
  - When enter the page with `?n` query param, open new tab with the home page, and the original tab will remain on the original page.
  - It may be useful for browser's home page button, which to open new tab not just move page.
